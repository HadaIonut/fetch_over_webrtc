Skibidy Open Sauce License (SOSL)
(Version 1.0 — Rizzed Up Edition)

PREAMBLE
Yooo, if you’re here, you’re tryna vibe with this code. Welcome to the squad. This software? It’s open like a 24-hour diner, no gatekeeping, no dry energy. Just straight facts, no cap. We're out here sharing the code sauce so everyone can level up, make that bread, and hit those W's. 💯

1. 📜 Permission, No Permission Slips Needed
You’re allowed to:

Download the code? Say less.
Run it? Duh.
Modify? Absolutely, flex that creativity.
Share? Go wild, spread the sauce.
But fr, just don't be that NPC who's not giving credit. Always keep the OG authors in the convo, because credit is a major W.
2. 🛠 Modding and Remixing
You got that skibidy rizz? Remix this code all you want. You can tweak, flip, reverse-engineer, whatever—just don’t turn it into some low-effort L. Keep it crispy, and don’t forget to drop some rizz on the OG license when you re-up with your version. Major fax, no printer.

3. 💸 Commercial Use (Securing the Bag)
If you’re tryna use this to chase that bag, it’s all cool with us. Secure the dub, fr. But make sure you play it right and let everyone know this app was built with this open sauce, no cap. Don’t front like it’s all you. We all out here tryna glow up. 🌟

4. 😡 Liability and Warranty (Or Lack Thereof)
If this code does an oopsie, that’s on you, chief. We’re out here sharing the sauce, but if it blows up your setup or steals your girl, don’t come @ us. You’re on your own, fam. This software comes "AS IS"—if it flops, it flops. No rizz, no responsibility. Use it at your own risk, fr.

5. ✌️ Respect the Rizz (No Toxics Allowed)
You can’t use this code for anything grimy. Keep it 100, no shady ops, no scams, no L moves. We don’t tolerate sus activity in these streets. If you do something crusty with this code, you’ve officially lost your rizz.

6. 🔄 Redistribution (Pass the Aux)
You wanna pass this code to the squad? Go off, king/queen. You can redistribute it, remix it, whatever. But no cap, you gotta keep this license attached to it. Don’t pull a sneaky and make it proprietary. That’s straight clown behavior. 🤡 Keep it 100 and share the rizz.

7. 📅 Updates and Versions (Stay Fresh)
We might drop updates to this license whenever we feel like it. If you’re using a different version, peep the fine print. Always stay updated with the rizz, because old moves are Ls in the fast lane.

8. 💀 Termination (If You Lose the Vibe)
If you act like an op and violate this license, guess what? You lose all your sauce access. Instant L. You'll be ghosted from the rizz and can’t use the code anymore. Simple as that.

9. 🚀 Final Rizz
That’s it, chief. You’re all set to vibe with the code. Just remember, always bring the positive energy, share the sauce, and don’t be an L. This code belongs to the streets now, so make it count. Skibidy on.
